## VitaOrganizer 0.5.2

![](extra/screenshot-0.5.png)

Desktop tool for listing and uploading games and homebrew applications to PSVITA without the size requirements
of uploading the whole VPK and extracting it later.

It is written in Kotlin/Java.

It should work on Windows, Linux and MacOS. It is a Java desktop application, packed in an executable .JAR, that
can be executed directly with double click on most cases.

In other cases, you can run it with `java -jar vitaorganizer-0.5.2.jar`

You can download a prebuild binary here, or just build from source:

### Building from source

You can open build.gradle in intelliJ IDEA 2016.2 (Community Edition is ok) to get started directly.
The main class is defined in : `src/com/soywiz/vitaorganizer/VitaOrganizer.kt`

You can compile without intelliJ directly from the console just with gradle. Just call

```
gradle jar
```

It will generate the file `build/libs/vitaorganizer-VERSION.jar` with all the dependencies included as an executable jar
that should work on desktop java versions.

In order to generate a native windows executable:

```
gradle clean minimizedJar launch4j
```

It will generate the file `build/libs/vitaorganizer-VERSION.exe`. It uses launch4j as launcher,
and proguard for minimizing all the files so the executable will be smaller.

### Translations

VitaOrganizer supports localization. It uses the default ResourceBundle java system. It includes intelliJ support.
You can edit/create: `resources/com/soywiz/vitaorganizer/Texts_*.properties` files in order to translate the application.
You can edit those files easily using intelliJ. More information: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/editing-resource-bundle.html
Texts are referenced into intelliJ easily and allows to find back references.

In order to test several languages, you can launch the JVM with the following arguments:
```
-Duser.country=ES -Duser.language=es
```
